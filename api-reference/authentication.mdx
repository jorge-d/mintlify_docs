## Get your API key

Once we have given you access to the API, you can head over to your Siit dashboard and generate an API key at [this link](https://app.siit.io/settings/account/security).

Please note that only the _owner_ of the account can do this. Any re-generation will expire the previously generate key.

You would then use this API key as a **Bearer Token**:

    Once you have your key, you can ru the following command in a shell to ensure all is properly setup:

    ```
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN" https://api.siit.io/ping
    ```

    If the token is valid, the result should be:
    ```json
    {"result":"pong"}
    ```
