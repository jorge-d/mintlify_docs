## Introduction

**Siit** uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- `2xx` codes indicate success
- `4xx` codes indicate an error that failed given the information provided
- `5xx` codes indicate an error with Siit's servers

An `error` and a `troubleshoot` key will be present in the response payload body. The `troubleshoot` key is a readable description of the error.

More detailed HTTP response codes will be provided in endpoints documentation.
