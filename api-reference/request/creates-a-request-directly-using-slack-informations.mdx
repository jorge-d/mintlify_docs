title: "Create a Request [Slack Automations]"
openapi: post /v1/requests/slack
---

## Introduction

Use this route if you're plugging the request submission using [Slack Automation](https://api.slack.com/automations).

This avoid you having to fetch the user UIDs and instead directly use Slack User IDs.

A sample project interacting with this API is available [here](https://github.com/siitapp/slack-automation-sample).
